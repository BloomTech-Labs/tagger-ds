You **can** do just about _every_ kind of formatting possible with standard markdown, including:

* Creating bullet lists
* <del>strikethrough</del>
* **bold**
* _italics_
> quotes

### You can even do code blocks

```python
class Markdown:
  def __init__(self):
    self.awesome = True
```

The styling isn't perfect, but that can be adjusted in a number of ways, not least of which would
include the use of html tags.

Another edit!
