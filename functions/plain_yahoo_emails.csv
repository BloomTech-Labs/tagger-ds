In this context the Torah discusses the laws of Tum'a that apply to those who are under the same roof as a human corpse.  The Torah writes, ""This is the Torah [law] regarding a person who dies in a tent"" (19:14).  The Sages of the Talmud noted that this verse may allude to a different concept, as well, namely, the approach we should have toward Torah learning: ""Torah is sustained only within one who kills himself over it.""  According to this reading, the phrase, ""a person who dies in a tent"" is the description of how we should go about our Torah study - like someone who ""dies in a tent.""  What does it mean that one should ""kill himself"" over Torah, that we should be ""dead"" in regard to learning?  One explanation is that we should study Torah without any interruption, as though we were ""dead.""  A dead person does not receive phone calls, cannot attend any meetings, has no access to e-mail, and is not available for consultation.  The Talmud teaches that we should be similarly ""dead"" with respect to the period allotted for Torah learning.  During that period, we should be no more accessible than a dead person.  That time is sacred, designated exclusively for learning and for nothing else.  Today, this precept has become exceedingly difficult to follow.  Modern technology has given us cell phones and other gadgets that make us accessible at all times, no matter where we are.  Not too long ago, a man in the Bet Midrash could be reached only for emergencies, by calling the nearest payphone.  But today, it is harder than ever to act ""dead,"" to turn off all the communication devices and focus one's attention exclusively on the material one is studying without thinking or worrying about anything else.  I had a morning study partner who was a very successful businessman.  His policy was that he did not answer any phone calls until 1 pm every day. When we finished our learning session and he checked his fourteen or so messages, he discovered that the vast majority of the issues and problems for which he was called in the morning were somehow resolved by 1 pm.  An employee, for example, would call with a frantic problem at 9:00, and at 11:00 he would call back to report that the issue had worked itself out. Had this study partner not turned off his phone for those hours, he would have spent most of the time resolving problems that could have worked themselves out without him.  He understood the importance of ""dying in the tent,"" of making himself ""dead"" for Torah learning.  Unfortunately, this problem has affected prayer in the synagogue, as well. People find it too difficult to pull themselves away from their communication devices even during prayer services.  All too often we see people in the synagogue checking and sending messages when they are supposed to be focusing on the messages they wish to send to the Almighty.  Let us overcome this challenge and ensure to turn the gadgets off when the time comes to devote our minds to God and to Torah.  These periods of prayer and learning are simply too valuable and precious to waste.  Rather than allow ourselves to be distracted, we must make the most of these opportunities for meaningful and devoted engagement in prayer and study. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    ",3872,text/plain

Tax his land, Tax his bed, Tax the table At which he's fed. Tax his tractor, Tax his mule, Teach him taxes Are the rule. Tax his work, Tax his pay, He works for peanuts Anyway! Tax his cow, Tax his goat, Tax his pants, Tax his coat. Tax his ties, Tax his shirt, Tax his work, Tax his dirt. Tax his tobacco, Tax his drink, Tax him if he Tries to think. Tax his cigars, Tax his eers, If he cries Tax his tears Tax his car, Tax his gas, Find other ways To tax his ass. Tax all he has Then let him know That you won't be done Till he has no dough.  When he screams and hollers; Then tax him some more, Tax him till he's good and sore. Then tax his coffin, Tax his grave, Tax the sod in Which he's laid. Put these words Upon his tomb, Taxes drove me to my doom...' When he's gone, Do not relax, Its time to apply The inheritance tax.

Major Community Wide Tehilim Reading & Classes will be Held  1) December 3rd 10:30am -Ahi Ezer - OP & Ave. S. ~Woman Only~ 2) December 3rd 1:00pm-Ohel Simha(Park Ave Shul)~Woman Only~ 3) December 4th Minha 3:45pm -Ohel Simha- (Park Ave Shul)  Rabbi Kuessous is scheduled for Surgery THIS FRIDAY DEC. 4TH.   We know Hashem wants our tefillot and teshuba and we know Hashem yitbarach is all merciful especially when, we, His Children, pour out our hearts and move mountains to take on a new mitzvah or work on a middah.  The Rabbi has done so much for many of us on a personal level and for our children over many years.  IF WE EVER WANTED TO GIVE BACK, WE PROBABLY NEVER THOUGHT WE  COULD COME CLOSE TO WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR US - NOW IS OUR CHANCE.

1301,2118,Yeshivat Ohr Yerushalayim <office@yoy.org.il>,Re:,"Hi Jay, So the FedEx guy came this morning to pick up the envelope, I  forgot to ask when he thinks it will get to you, but Rabbi Stein said  probably Friday.  The tracking # is: 858061503539, so you can go  online to see where your package is holding.  Also, I stuck in an  envelope for my parents, if you could try to drop it off by them  whenever you get a chance (its nothing dachuf), the address is on the  outside, and you've been there a bunch of times... so that would be  great.  I will send pictures of Sima soon, iyh.  If you need anything else, be in touch!

Students, staff, faculty and community members donated enough much-needed medical and first-aid supplies, food and clothing to fill four vans for NOVA Hope for Haiti. We wish to extend a special thank you to the volunteers, especially leaders of several student organizations, who met in the Office of Diversity and Equity Programs to help sort, box and transport the donations. It is truly amazing what a group of committed volunteers can accomplish in such a short period of time!   Members of the college community can continue to donate to the American Red Cross Haiti relief efforts via Central Depository, third floor, Student Center.   New entering students will have an opportunity to contribute during the Orientation programs for freshmen and transfer students on Wednesday, January 20, and graduate students on Thursday, January 21, in the Student Center.   ------------------------------------------------------------ To manage your subscription to Brooklyn College eAlerts, please visit https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/eAlerts Brooklyn College is located at 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210.

It is always good  to understand your options to find the one that is best for you.   Players from the US may cash out via any of the following methods:  - Instant eChecks   An eCheck is an electronic check which allows you to make safe,  secure and immediate electronic fund transfers (EFT) directly from  your bank account to your PokerStars account.   Funds deposited via eCheck are immediately available in your  PokerStars account even though the funds are not received from your  bank account instantly. For more information about eChecks, please  visit http://www.pokerstars.com/poker/real-money/echecks/.   Once you have made an eCheck deposit which has cleared, you may  choose to receive your funds credited back to your bank account on  the Cash Out screen.   - Checks   If you would like to receive a check directly from PokerStars, we  process them five times per week (Monday through Friday).    The minimum you can request on any one check is $25 and the maximum  is $2,500.   All checks, regardless of the amount, are sent by First-Class Mail -  we do not deliver checks via UPS or FedEx or any other courier  service.

2157,3453,"""Karen L. Gould, President"" <bcpresident@brooklyn.cuny.edu>",The Community's Response to the Earthquake in Haiti,"Welcome back to campus.=20  As you are aware, the nation of Haiti was struck by a deadly earthquake on January 12. The impact of this tragedy and its devastation has hit home for many of us, including students, faculty and staff of Brooklyn College (BC) who are part of the Haitian Diaspora, many of whom have received sorrowful news about loved ones and friends.  The world has responded quickly to aid the people of Haiti. At the request of Chancellor Matthew Goldstein, CUNY has organized a university-wide response to coordinate activities and share information. Brooklyn College has designated Dave Bryan, special assistant to the dean of Student Affairs, to serve as our campus relief coordinator. To date, several relief activities and community-sponsored events have occurred or will take place on campus:  * Nearly $3,000 was collected by the Brooklyn College Haitian American Students Association (HASA), the Inter-Greek Council, BC Cheerleaders, and through walk-in individual donations to the Central Depository for the American Red Cross and Y=E9le.  * Medical supplies, clothing, school supplies and food were collected by HASA, the Office of Affirmative Action and Diversity Compliance and the Haitian Bilingual/ESL Assistance Center (HABETAC).  * On February 4, Assemblymember Rhoda Jacobs and Councilman Dr. Mathieu Eugene, in conjunction with the Children Foundation for Help in Haiti, Inc., organized a ""Gathering in Solidarity"" in support of the Haitian Community. The event was held at the Walt Whitman Theater and was hosted by the Office Diversity and Equity Programs and the Golden Key International Honour Society of Brooklyn College.  * HASA, the BC Chapter of the American Red Cross, the Black Students Union and the Caribbean Students Union hosted a Haiti Relief Awareness, ""EDE AYITI: HELP HAITI"" on February 4.  * The Beraca Baptist Church, located at 9602 Flatlands Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11236, is raising funds for health care, crisis counseling, rescue and recovery, and reconstruction. Call 718.257.1000, ext. 306.  * President Obama has designated Haitians for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which is valid for eighteen months and will allow eligible Haitians an opportunity to obtain work authorization. TPS is available to Haitian nationals who were present in the U.S. as of January 12, 2010, and are continuously residing in the U.S.  Qualified individuals have until July 20, 2010 to apply for TPS.  The Legal Aid Society has been identified by New York City as one of the key organizations to assist eligible Haitian immigrants in receiving TPS. The Society's Immigration Law Unit has set up a Haitian TPS Hotline. Call 888.284.2772, or visit the website at www.legal-aid.org . You may also contact the office of Assemblywoman Rhoda Jacobs at 718.434.0446 for more information.  The work of assisting the people of Haiti is ongoing. Throughout the semester, we will continue to engage in relief-related activities and assist members of the campus community who are of Haitian descent or who have family in Haiti.  Students in need of personal or academic support for a range of issues, including tuition and other financial matters, should contact Student Assistance and Referral, 2106 Boylan Hall, 718.951.5352, studentsar@brooklyn.cuny.edu.  Counseling services are available for students, faculty and staff at the Personal Counseling Program, located at 0203 James Hall, 718.951.5363, or visit http://pc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.  To share or receive information about upcoming Haitian relief activities on campus, please contact Dave Bryan at 718.951.5352, or e-mail dbyran@brooklyn.cuny.edu.  Regular updates will be posted on the BC WebCentral Portal, https://portal.brooklyn.edu, and the college Facebook page, http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brooklyn-NY/Brooklyn-College/111090580325?ref=3Dts.  The sensitivity and generosity of the Brooklyn College community have made a difference both in our borough and on the Republic of Haiti.  These goodwill efforts will surely continue this semester and in the future.   Karen L.

2352,3713,Office of Financial Aid <finaid@brooklyn.cuny.edu>,Financial Aid: Dropping or Withdrawing From Classes,"A common concern of students when dropping or withdrawing from their classes is how will this affect my financial aid eligibility? In other words, will I still be eligible for financial aid and will I have to pay anything to the college?  If you dropped before or on February 17th you are not eligible for any federal aid.  Tuition liability (the percentage of your bill that you are liable for once the first day of classes begins) began on January 28th. The liability schedule for the Spring 2010 semester is as follows:   Spring 2010 Schedule of Tuition Refund and Student Liability 0% Liability	Drop prior to January 28 25% Liability	Drop January 28-February 3 50% Liability	Drop February 4-10 75% Liability	Drop February 11-17 100% Liability	Withdraw February 18 and thereafter    For example, if you dropped a class between Jan 28th - Feb 3rd, you would be responsible for 25% of your tuition cost plus tuition fees. After Feb. 18th and thereafter, you will be able to withdraw from classes with a W grade but you would be 100% liable for the cost of your tuition.  NOTE: A WN grade is given to students who never began attendance in a course. If so; the student will be considered to not have earned any Title IV aid. Students will be liable for the tuition.  How does dropping or withdrawing from classes affect my federal financial aid?  If you drop/withdraw from some or all of your courses before April 5th, your federal financial aid may be affected. The federal funds that are affected are listed below in the order of how they are affected:  * Unsubsidized Stafford Loans * Subsidized Stafford Loans * Perkins Loans * Graduate PLUS Loan * Parent PLUS Loan * Pell Grant * Academic Competiveness Grant (ACG) * National SMART Grant * TEACH Grant   Financial aid is calculated based on the percentage of studies that have been completed. For example, if you have completed 30 percent of the days of the term, then you are entitled to 30 percent of the financial aid that you were scheduled to receive calculated on a pro-rated basis. The percentage of aid that you have earned is applied to your tuition and fees but this may not cover your entire tuition obligation. If you have a balance after financial aid is applied, you must remit payment to the college immediately. Once you have completed more than 60 percent of the days in the term, you will have earned all of the aid that you were scheduled to receive for that term.  What will happen if I stop attending classes or do not officially withdraw from classes?  If you leave school during the semester without officially withdrawing, the college will attempt to verify your last date of attendance. Once this is determined, we will determine how much aid you are eligible based on the federal withdrawal calculation.    What if after dropping or withdrawing from classes, I do not have enough aid to cover my tuition obligation?  You must repay the required amount during the term in which you withdraw. Failure to repay the required amount will result in a stop being placed on your records and you will not be able to obtain a transcript or register until repayment is made. If your accounts balance in not settled, your account may be sent to a collection agency.  What if I have earned more financial aid than I initially received?  In some cases, you may be entitled to post-withdrawal funds. A post-withdrawal disbursement is funds that are posted to your account after you have dropped or withdrew from classes. If the post-withdrawal disbursement include loans, written permission is required before we can disburse the funds to you. You may choose to decline some or all of the loan funds to avoid incurring debt.  I decided that I would like to drop or withdraw from classes, what should I do?  You should consult with a financial aid counselor before dropping or withdrawing from classes to determine if a financial obligation will incur. You can speak to a representative from financial aid by calling 718-951-5051 or by visiting the Enrollment Services Center located in the Lobby of the West Quad building.     ------------------------------------------------------------ To manage your subscription to Brooklyn College eAlerts, please visit https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/eAlerts Brooklyn College is located at 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210.

 Trefousse Set for March 11","The Department of History mourns the loss of its long-time colleague Hans Trefousse.  A memorial will be held on Thursday, March 11, at 2:30 p.m. in Tanger Auditorium of the Brooklyn College Library.  Friends, former colleagues, and the public are invited to attend.  Born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1921, Professor Trefousse graduated from City College of New York in 1942, and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1950.  During the Second World War, he served as Captain in U.S. Army Intelligence.  After teaching part-time in the School of General Studies beginning in 1946, he rose in the ranks from Instructor to Distinguished Professor in a career at Brooklyn College that lasted half a century (1950-1999).  He was still teaching at the college's Institute for Retirees in Pursuit of Education in fall 2009.  Recipient of the Brooklyn College Distinguished Teacher Award, a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, and a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies, Professor Trefousse was a specialist in the history of the American Civil War and Reconstruction.  He published widely and right up to the end of his life.  Among his many major works are studies of reconstruction and radical republicanism and biographies of Andrew Johnson, Rutherford B. Hayes, Carl Schurz, and Thaddeus Stevens.   ------------------------------------------------------------ To manage your subscription to Brooklyn College eAlerts, please visit https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/eAlerts Brooklyn College is located at 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210.

Its intent is to alert those students who are applying for financial aid for these upcoming terms regarding the May 1, 2010 filing date.  Please note that your 2010-2011 FAFSA must be filed by May 1, 2010 in order for your aid to be appropriately applied by the payment deadlines for the upcoming semesters (summer and/or fall 2010). If you do not file your FAFSA by this date, your aid will still be processed for the year but you will risk not having it available at the time term payment is due.

2659,4148,"""Peter L. Pampalone, First Year Specialist, CAASS"" <PeterP@brooklyn.cuny.edu>",Brooklyn College: First Year Academic Advisor Greeting,"My name is Peter Pampalone, and I am the First Year Specialist for The Center for Academic Advisement and Student Success (CAASS). I hope your semester is going well so far. We most likely met at registration.  I just wanted to send out a quick greeting welcoming you to Brooklyn College and inviting you to come see me, so you can receive some one-on-one advisement regarding college-wide requirements, first year strategies, or any other issues you would like addressed.    I am available for appointments Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9:30am to 4:30pm. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I am also available from 9:30am to 4: 30pm; these days are the Center's walk-in days, so no appointment is necessary. If you want to see me specifically, you may e-mail me at peterp@brooklyn.cuny.edu and let me know you are going to be dropping by to see me. The coming weeks in March have historically been lighter in terms of student volume. This means that it would be in your best interest to schedule some time to come and meet with me because I will have greater availability, thus there will be more open appointment slots for you to choose from.   Also, I am more than happy to answer any question through e-mail.  Send me your questions or concerns, and if it turns out that I cannot handle your issue just through an e-mail, we can arrange a meeting.   To make an appointment, please do the following:    - Log on to the BC portal  - Click the Advisement tab  - Scroll under the Academic Advisement bar  - Click the Schedule an Advisement Appointment button  - Follow prompts to make an appointment.    I look forward to meeting with you to clarify anything that is unclear and to ensure that the transition to Brooklyn College is as smooth a process as possible. Please feel free to get in touch with me.   Be on the lookout for an e-mail regarding special workshops geared for freshmen students preparing to take the English 1 Exit Exam--coming soon!

2845,4401,"""Chave Jacobsohn"" <chave@designsbyfmc.com>",,"9 Nisan  One who creates a small defect in the body creates a great defect in the soul (Maggid of Mezritch ).  A student spied the great Hillel leaving his academy. He approached the Sage and asked him where he was going. ""I am going to do a mitzvah for someone poor and forsaken,"" Hillel answered. Noting his student's bewilderment, he then explained: ""I am going to feed my body. It is totally dependent upon me to look after it.""  If someone gives us an object for safekeeping, we have a responsibility to look after it and cannot be derelict in its care. Likewise, our bodies have been entrusted to us, and we have a full obligation to care properly for them.  Too many of us violate our trust by taking unnecessary risks or doing things which are detrimental to our bodies, such as smoking, overeating, or abusing alcohol and drugs. Is it not strange that one who would never think of drinking a non-diet soft drink might not have the least hesitance in smoking a cigarette, even though the harmful effects of smoking are now established beyond a shadow of a doubt?  A Chassidic master observed one of his followers who looked lean and weak. On inquiring, he learned that this man was fasting frequently to atone for his sins. He then told him: ""First you set out to ruin your soul, and having achieved this, you are now out to ruin your body as well.""   Today I shall ... ... remember that I am fully responsible for the well-being of my body, and I shall take every means to protect it from harm.     ",1508,text/plain

Wouldn't be surprised if they reduced guarantees again as they still overlay a decent bit.   I still play here because software is great and games are very very soft. The overlay helps too. I definitely miss the 20% overlay in the $109 everynight but it seems to meet the $7500 Guarantee everyday now.

The only options given to me were bitcoin and credit card.   The credit card is not a direct option but is a link to a bitcoin processor ""Simplex"".      Not wanting to get into bitcoin wallets,I chose the second option ""credit card"" through Simplex.  It actually worked very well, the only difference from using a credit card was I had to upload a photo of the front and back of my driver's license.   After I did that, the deposit went through in a few minutes.  The difference between my CC charge and my deposit was 13%.   I understand that there are various fees in buying and sending bitcoin and I would expect the convenience of sending bitcoin without having to set up a bitcoin purchasing account and a personal wallet might rate a higher fee.   What pissed me off is I was never informed of the fee amount of even the existence of a fee by Carbon or Simplex.  This is bull****.  I complained to Carbon and they replied to the effect of ""That's why we give you a 20% bonus. If you don't want to use Simplex here's a link on how to use Bitcoin"".  Which of course didn't address my issue of the non-disclosure of the fee amount.

For every 50$ you spend in rake, you get 10$ added to your account.  This is released in 10$ chunks, so if you spend 49$ in rake you get 0.

Rescue Me will be helping thousands of individuals and shelters in the coming weeks adopt out pets displaced by Michael.  This storm hit close to home for us=E2=80=A6 literally. While we work nationally and internationally helping pets everywhere, Rescue Me also operates its own center for special needs animals on 135-acres in Georgia. I was at the center last night, and we still have contractors on site, as the edge of the eye of Michael passed within 40 miles of us. Here=E2=80=99s a video of our center from a couple years ago (we=E2=80=99ve found homes for more than a quarter million more animals since then): https://www.RescueMe.org/video  This week was supposed to just be a celebration for Rescue Me hitting 777,777 adoptions soon =E2=80=94 and we=E2=80=99re still running our free Petco Gift Card giveaway described on our homepage to celebrate that. Instead, however, it is turning into one of the greatest pet emergencies we have faced since Rescue Me was started.  Please donate to Rescue Me or any of the hundreds of other shelters and rescues who will be helping pets left homeless by the hurricane today. Financial donations are just one way to help. Equally helpful, adopt a pet in need (click view available pets above) or volunteer at a local shelter or rescue.  - Jeff Gold Founder, Rescue Me!

I'll answer some questions you may have:  WHEN WILL SOMEONE REPLY TO MY EMAIL?  Your are more likely to receive a quick reply if you email about multiple animals, not just one.  Rescue Me acts as a referral service, the people you email are either individuals or representatives of rescue groups we work with, but are not a direct part of Rescue Me!  Some may respond quickly, others may take a few days to respond or may not respond at all.  Try not to put all your hopes on adopting one particular animal.  HOW CAN I INCREASE MY CHANCES OF ADOPTING?  Click below to sign up for free Rescue Alerts to get notified when new animals of the breed(s) you select are posted:          http://www.RescueMe.org/alerts  WHAT IF SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH A POST, OR SOMEONE DOESN'T GET BACK TO ME?  Click 'Problems/Corrections' at the bottom of a post to report this.  WHAT IF I FIND OUT AN ANIMAL HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED?  Help us keep Rescue Me updated, click 'Mark as Unavailable' at the bottom of that post.  HOW CAN I HELP RESCUE ME HELP MORE ANIMALS?  Please copy/paste our website address   www.RescueMe.org   into your Facebook status, to share our service with friends and family.  Remember, each time you rescue instead of buying a pet, you save many lives, not just one.  In addition to saving the rescued animal, you leave more room at shelters and rescue groups for others in need.  If you buy from a pet store or breeder, somewhere else an animal will likely be euthanized due to overpopulation, and your purchase will encourage breeders to breed even more.  There are far too many animals of all types, including purebreds =E2=80=94 millions end up euthanized every year.  We intend not to just reduce this number, but to work toward completely stopping this practice in the years ahead.  We can only do so with YOUR help, so please rescue!

He actually ""abused"" their bonuses unknowingly in which he would receive funds and use them for poker when the rollover was incomplete.. so we came to a conclusion that Merge had actually been pretty lenient with him considering he benefited from a couple thousand in buyins without fully completing rollover.

Merge is not very detailed about how their bonuses need to be released.  _________________________  BTC max wd (2500)  Req 8/24 Rec 8/31   All the best, Two Plus Two Poker Forums  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Unsubscription information:  To unsubscribe from this thread, please visit this page: https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/subscription.php?do=removesubscription&type=thread&subscriptionid=7697837&auth=50feaeb11d1bda5c51d01cd52823b218 ",1689,text/plain

But, when withdrawing from Carbon, you don't have actually use the ""request"" tab on Blockchain, right? It's confusing also because on Blockchain, it says that the address changes for every transaction. I'm  guessing that because of that, I also have to wait until the 1st transaction clears, until sending the next amount since I will have to use a different address. ************ Re: Merge Network: Carbon/ Sportsbook/ PlayersOnly - Deposit/ Withdrawal Thread https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showthread.php?p=54156793#post54156793 Posted by: bufo alvarius On: 08-13-2018 05:50 PM  No problem - yeah it's the one that pops up when you hit 'request' - you just copy and paste that into Carbon when you cash out.

I've heard of them not accepting transactions from internet gambling sites but haven't experienced it personally. Using Coinbase as the last step to get to your bank account is totally fine/will always work. ************ Re: Merge Network: Carbon/ Sportsbook/ PlayersOnly - Deposit/ Withdrawal Thread https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showthread.php?p=54149799#post54149799 Posted by: NZdice On: 08-11-2018 08:50 PM  Yes, I am setting up blockchain wallet right now. A little confused, as there's an option right there with blockchain to deposit bitcoin directly to your bank account, but everyone seems to 1st send the bitcoin to coinbase and from there deposit it to their bank. Blockchain a little confusing as well, as it says you cant use your wallet id on another site to receive funds, but you 1st have to click ""request,"" and then use the code... you get the picture. Actually, if someone could walk me through the exact process here (like specific information about what click on and what you copy and paste and where), I would really appreciate it. Or, probably someone as already done this, in which case a link to that would be great. ************ Re: Merge Network: Carbon/ Sportsbook/ PlayersOnly - Deposit/ Withdrawal Thread https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showthread.php?p=54151352#post54151352 Posted by: bufo alvarius On: 08-12-2018 11:09 AM  Sure!  Deposit: -Deposit on Coinbase with your bank account. -Get on Blockchain and select ""request"" (lower right). -Copy your wallet address by tapping it - which will automatically copy it. -Go back to Coinbase and go to 'accounts' and select 'BTC Wallet' -Select the arrow top right of screen and put in the amount of USD you want to send to block chain and hit 'Next' -Paste your blockchain address in and hit sent. -Once the funds appear in your blockchain app (which should be pretty fast) -On Carbon - go to deposit + enter the amount + add the 30% weekly bonus or whatever bonus you can, copy the bitcoin address on there and paste that in blockchain as the address you send to. Funds should be in there pretty much immediately.   Withdraw: -Enter amount, paste in your blockchain address + enter your pin. Has been taking about 5 business days for most people. -Go to Coinbase and copy your bitcoin address (accounts->BTC wallet-> the square thing next to the arrow top right). -Go to blockchain -> send -> paste address + put in amount and you're all set.. -In coinbase, withdraw to your bank account. ************ Re: Merge Network: Carbon/ Sportsbook/ PlayersOnly - Deposit/ Withdrawal Thread https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showthread.php?p=54151754#post54151754 Posted by: goodsaint On: 08-12-2018 01:00 PM   ---Quote (Originally by NZdice)--- Yes, I am setting up blockchain wallet right now.

You will need to go through a verification process like you did with Coinbase. Just use the  Blockchain wallet without options.

Now, if this is the beginning of a trend towards withdrawals increasing from the present 5-7 business days, then Houston, we've got a problem. Some would say, with other sites cashing folks out within 1-3 days, this is a problem now.

The reason being is that there is liability for credit card deposits. Long-standing liability that can last 6-12 months for a site. However, Bitcoin is non-refundable.   The fear, and this happens in practice, is that a player deposits with a credit card, plays, and requests a withdrawal. A site pays it in crypto-currency and then, months later, the player initiates a charge back on the credit card. Now the gambling site is screwed with zero ways to recover their lost funds.  Very few people are allowed to do CC deposits and Crypto withdrawals, industry wide. In fact, I only know of it happening in a few select cases to satisfy long-standing whales. Otherwise, most sites learned very quickly that this was a bad idea.  -- Kahn   All the best, Two Plus Two Poker Forums  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Unsubscription information:  To unsubscribe from this thread, please visit this page: https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/subscription.php?do=removesubscription&type=thread&subscriptionid=7697837&auth=50feaeb11d1bda5c51d01cd52823b218 ",2595,text/plain

Missed UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES will be made up on Wednesday, May 19th, i.e., May 19th will follow a Friday class schedule for UNDERGRADUATE COURSES. UNDERGRADUATE FINAL EXAMS originally scheduled for May 19th will be held on Wednesday, May 26th. Thus the UNDERGRADUATE final exam period will extend from May 20th through May 26th.  For GRADUATE CLASSES, however, May 19th will be the first day of the final exam/class meeting period, i.e., GRADUATE CLASSES that meet during the semester on Wednesdays will have their final exam/class meeting on May 19th. The GRADUATE final exam/class meeting period will extend therefore from May 19th through May 25th.

This is an important project that will help the College attract students, increase our visibility and strengthen our message.   The photographer, Bob Handelman; his assistant, Jason Rogers; and the account manager for our marketing firm, BethAnne Hoffmann-Garcia, will be on campus Monday, April 26, to Friday, April 30. While individual students have already agreed to participate in photo shoots, other general shots of the campus and our facilities may inadvertently include other members of the College community (including faculty and staff) who have not personally agreed to be included.   The photographers are very sensitive to the wishes of our students and the academic mission of the community. All precautions will be made to ensure that classes and other activities during the week will not be disturbed. If you do not wish to be included in a shot, please let the photographers know and they will ensure that you will not be in the frame.  However, we ask for your cooperation and understanding as we complete this stage of the project and would appreciate any help and assistance you can extend.   Thank you.

Click the Ask-a-Librarian button on the home page, then click on the ""chat""  button and ask a question, which will be fielded by Brooklyn College Library staff or by any librarian participating in our network of reference librarians. This on-demand reference service spans all hours of the day or night, whether or not the physical building is open.  * Students can borrow a laptop to help finish last-minute work. Laptops can be borrowed for one to three days, and are available at the New Media desk on second floor of the library.  * During the exam period, the main library is open Monday-Thursday, 8 a.m.-midnight; Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. The Library Caf=E9 is on a 24/7 schedule and will be staffed for the duration of exams.  * Summer Hours begin after Memorial Day: Monday and Thursday, 9 a.m.-6 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.; and Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. The library will be closed on Saturday and Sunday.=20  * The library has a number of group study rooms available.

Policies are located at http://dewey.brooklyn.cuny.edu/library/about/events/index.php?view=3Droom_map&unit=3Dgs.  * Regarding quiet study space: The library does not have designated silent study areas but requests that students be courteous to their fellow users, utilize headphones for personal listening devices, put cell phones on vibrate and take any cell phone conversations to the stairwells.  * Remember, drinks are permitted in the library as long as they are in no-spill containers, such as bottles with caps or go-cups. Food, however, is not permitted in the library.  Thank you, and good luck on your final exams!  =20 Stephanie R.

Please use the http://www.supportcuny.org website, scroll down to the 2010/11 New York City Council Campaign, select the appropriate letter to send to members of the City Council, and urge them to support our Vallone scholars.

The grade is ABS -- ABSENT FROM FINAL.       This is the original grade that was submitted by your instructor after final exams. If the grade has been changed since then, this e-mail does not reflect that change. Please note that although your grade has been submitted by your instructor, it may take 5-10 business days for it to appear on your transcript.       Due to new CUNY rules, ABS and FAB grades do not appear on student transcripts. Instead, the ABS grade will automatically be translated into an INC grade in WebSIMS and transcripts, and an internal transcript comment will indicate that the INC was assigned on account of a missed final. This ABS grade will eventually either be changed to a standard grade if you are allowed to take a make-up absentee final exam, or an FIN if that does not occur.         BC's internal systems such as the WebCentral Portal will show the ABS grade until it is resolved. You can verify the ABS status of the course in the WebCentral Portal under the My Info tab, in ""My Schedule and Grades"" channel.

If you intend to use financial aid to cover any portion of your fall 2010 tuition and fees, please read the following ""Top 5 Recommendations"" designed to provide you with the best possible service and assist you in avoiding unnecessary delays in processing.  TOP 5 Recommendations  1. Register for your classes as soon as possible.  In order for your financial aid to properly displayed on your account you need to be registered. Additionally, this makes the processing of your awards much smoother since it can be determined if you are full or part-time.  2. File a 2010-2011 FAFSA and complete the financial aid process.  If your Student Aid Reports indicate that additional information needs to be submitted to the financial aid office, please do so immediately.  Documentation and loan applications can be faxed to (718) 951-4778 or mailed to the financial aid office, or submitted at the Enrollment Services Center.  3. Submit your direct loan application now.  Applications are available on our website.  Do not wait until August to submit loan applications. It will seriously hinder your ability to secure registration and to receive funds for books, etc.  4. Graduate Students are especially urged to complete the loan application and the Rights and Responsibilities document process now.  Do not wait until the start of the semester to begin.  5. Sign up for the CUNY Scholar Support Card, or the Direct Deposit program. These are the fastest and easiest ways to access your financial aid funds.  This will allow electronic deposits of all refunds to your account.  Specifics about each can be found in the July issue of the ""Financial Aid Flash"" at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/pub/1401.htm  on the Brooklyn College financial aid web page.

Although this grade does not carry an academic penalty, it does carry a financial liability. In other words, if you register for classes and receive WN grades, you are responsible for 100% of the tuition for those courses.   Therefore it is very important that you inform the College by September 8, 2010 if you do not intend to attend classes this semester. You may do so by e-mailing us at bcbursar@brooklyn.cuny.edu and using the subject line ""Fall Attendance"". Please include your full name and the last four digits of your student Id number.

Department classrooms and facilities will be clearly marked and directional signage will be posted to help guide students, faculty, and staff.  Demolition of the interior spaces will begin either Thursday, October 28 or Friday, October 29.  The College community and the contractors will share corridors so we ask that for everyone's safety, please follow construction signage and the occasional, but necessary, requests by workmen to detour or move away from construction activities.  To avoid unnecessary disruptions of classes and offices, we have requested that the contractors schedule any noise-producing work for the off hours.  The Roosevelt Hall swing space--expected to be completed by the end of the fall semester-will be ready for use by the Theater Department and the Conservatory of Music by the start of the Spring Semester.  ------------------------------------------------------------ To manage your subscription to Brooklyn College eAlerts, please visit https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/ealerts Brooklyn College is located at 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210.

As a part of this partnership, Brooklyn College students will be offered a $10 annual membership to TDF, a savings of $20. Here are the benefits of membership as published on the TDF website, www.tdf.org:  ""TDF membership is your ticket to the performing arts at affordable prices. Our members enjoy access to hundreds of Broadway, Off-Broadway, music and dance productions each year for only $11 to $39 a ticket. Additionally, we've just launched a new service for our members, 'Off-Off @ $9,' where dozens of Off-Off-Broadway productions are available to you for only $9 a ticket.""    Given the current prices of Broadway theater and New York Philharmonic tickets, if you go to only one performance a year you would be saving money. I hope you will consider taking advantage of this partnership, which will enable you to more affordably enjoy great performances from our city's most distinguished cultural institutions.

5968,8936,"""Donald A. Wenz, Office of Campus Security and Public Safety"" <security@brooklyn.cuny.edu>",CELL PHONE / I POD THEFTS VICINITY OF CAMPUS RD.,"This office has become aware of what appears to be an increase in incidents involving the ""snatching"" of cell phones and I pods in the vicinity of Campus Road and the Junction area. Even though the majority of reported incidents do not involve the Brooklyn College Community, it is important to have this information to avoid being a victim. Persons travelling to and from campus should, if at all possible, avoid talking on cell phones and avoid wearing ear buds, since it appears that perpetrators target those individuals. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and travel in pairs or more, if possible. Utilize the College's Shuttle which travels around the campus perimeter and to the local subways. During the upcoming Holiday Season, which traditionally has shown an increase in these types of crimes, take steps to increase your personal safety.

6492,9666,"""Louise Hainline, Dean of Research and Graduate Studies"" <sems@brooklyn.cuny.edu>",Earn and Learn this summer - Summer Research Externship Database,"If you are still trying to decide what to do this summer, consider a paid academic research placement. Graduate and some professional schools favor students who have had research experience in the discipline the student is pursuing, the more the better. Doing research with faculty mentors can lead to better letters of recommendation and better insights into how to choose the right graduate program. While this can include working with a Brooklyn College faculty member, doing research at another site as an undergraduate can improve your chances for getting into the best graduate and professional programs.  Fortunately, to recruit students to their graduate schools, many excellent universities offer the opportunity to do research with a faculty member over the summer. These programs typically pay you a stipend, as much as $4000-5000 for the summer, and typically provide funding for housing and travel as well. The shortest ones are 6 weeks and the longest around 10 weeks.  Each year, the NIH MARC program at BC creates a searchable database of many summer externships, posted at: http://www.sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu/research/. You can search by school (pull down menu) or by discipline (search box). If you type in ""National Science Foundation"", you will get the url for a site at http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cfm where you can also search all the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduate programs as many are not included in our database. If you are in the sciences and some social sciences, check that link out as well.   Please note that we do not have any more information about these programs than what appears here. Do not contact us about any specific program's information. You have to contact the program through the contact person or info listed and do your own searching. If a link is broken, email louiseh@brooklyn.cuny.edu and we will try to fix any broken links.   Some tips on using this resource to best advantage:  ** Start as soon as you can, as many of the most competitive programs have deadlines in January and February. You will need letters of recommendation and faculty may not be around during the winter break, so we recommend you check with the professors you would be asking to find out whether they can write you a letter if you need them before next semester. There are plenty of options for later applications as well, but most are no later than March or April.   ** Most applications request a transcript, letters of recommendation and a statement of purpose (to explain your interest in the field, describe prior research experience, and explain your academic goals in the field; it's not a personal historym despite being sometimes called a ""personal statement""). If you have never written one of these, the url http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/642/01/ links to one of the many websites with tips on writing the personal statement. We suggest you always have someone experienced read your statement before you submit it.   **  To use the database, type in the name of an academic discipline or subdiscipline or a specific school, and hit ""submit"" to see what matches your interests. The majority of these opportunities are in the sciences. Search on the discipline or topic of interest. It helps to start with broader search terms and work down to more specific ones. Try several means of searching. The descriptions provided by the programs are used and these are not standardized.   **   In areas outside of science, try searching on terms like ""humanities"" or ""arts"". There are fewer of these, but there are some great programs in the database for non-sciences and social sciences.   ** There has also been an increase in programs specifically for students interested in medicine (search ""medicine"", ""premed"", ""dental""). However, if a program says it is for students interested in ""research degrees"" or Ph.D's, students who have medical interests will be screened out, so consider this as you choose where to apply.   ** The placements in the database are mostly academic or governmental. If you want a business or professional internship, you should contact the Magner Center.   ** Some listings indicate they are primarily for ""under-represented"" students, but this term is being broadened, so it can include students who are the first in their families to go to college, or from low-income circumstances, or with disabilities, so be sure to read  carefully what students are eligible to apply for each. It never hurts to email to ask if you are eligible.  ** There are programs for students at all undergraduate levels, including freshmen. Some programs have minimum gpas or other considerations. These are listed with each entry. If nothing appears, the information we had did not include this information, and you should check the with the program.   We have had many students do these summer externships and have had wonderful experiences that have expanded their horizons and improved their credentials at the same time they have earned a stipend that pays more than many summer jobs. We would like more Brooklyn College undergraduates to have this experience. Good luck!   ------------------------------------------------------------ To manage your subscription to Brooklyn College eAlerts, please visit https://websql.brooklyn.cuny.edu/ealerts Brooklyn College is located at 2900 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11210.

One and a quarter hour later....          Take the tunnel and go straight then just follow the signs and you'll get to Eilat. You can't miss it.         Fifteen minutes later....         We missed the tunnel                  Back on track 3 hours left and will be in eilat            6 hours later... Due to sandstorm and bathroom breaks we are just getting to the Dead Sea. An hour left till Eilat.        Now we're in Eilat and the trip is really starting. Arriving at the we are stunned, such a nice hotel for such a cheap price. We go to the desk to check in. Nope your looking for our other branch, the lady said. Arriving at our actual hotel we are stunned, still from the first hotel it would have been great to stay there. But this place is perfect, five guys in a room with one big bed and a bunkbed. We we're hungry so we went for pizza the only kosher food we could find. Delicious. After eating we went to look for things to do, and found a pyramid that seemed to be a branch of AppleTM. We sure had to check it out, it had huge letters on the top....I-MAX. Turns out it was a place that shows 3-D movies. So went on a roller-coaster that didn't move. After that we decided to call it a night partly due to dizziness. ( P.s. And I know these usually go on the bottom...we davened mincha before we left but had to find a minyan for maariv,we did, in chabad and the did chant yechi adoshen....) Monday.      We awoke early to go to chabad and davened shacris. We waited to have an early lunch of yep that's right,,pizza.then we were off to the oceanarium a beautiful place. We saw sharks get fed and turtles and these real radical fish and this video/ride about scuba diving whale sharks. Or maybe it was scuba divers saving whale sharks idk the seats moved so it was hard to see the screen. Well after that we decided to go a.t.v.ing we found a really awesome place and spent and hour on the quads rippin thru the dessert. It was already getting late so we made a great barbeque compliments to our own chef.  Tuesday: We woke davened went scuba diving and had pizza nothing crazy. What you went scuba diving!!!,!?!?!?!? Oh yeah it was amazing what a great experience you have to go.. Wow words can't explain but they can't thank you. So I would love to thank you mom.  For giving me a great vacation so that I can get back to yeshiva and grow spiritually and mature maturally.                           ThanxX0X0                                   Love !BB!   P.S.S. Also thanx to ta P.S.S.S. I really hope I didn't spend too much......       Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile    ",3941,text/plain
