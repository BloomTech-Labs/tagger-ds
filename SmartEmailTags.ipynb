Surprised your shorts are still so confident.  Trade shorts are quickly losing confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum.  I think curve flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down. 1.  jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve.  For market area sales, add on basis and dec and march are next.  Question is whether there is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the producing region.  A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineering reasons.  Million dollar question. 2.  Think Nov bidweek will be weak.  Don't know who baseload buyers are unless trade gets bullish.  Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections.  stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities will be planning to meet load using stg.  At current prices, producers apply more pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back.  Dont think gas market can handle that. 3.  No clue.  -----Original Message----- From: Abramo, Caroline Sent: Tue 10/16/2001 10:21 PM To: Arnold, John Cc: Subject: market   awesome call on cash.. it does not get any better than that.. you picked the bottom-  i am getting it slowly.. lots of calls today from people i do not speak to every day.. not too much panic from guys who are short.. most looking to put more on.. selling dec01 outright or buying gas daily puts on dec and jan... except pulaski  who pared down dec01 short with us from 4000 to 1000.. do not think he's got on alot elsewhere.  no one has anything on longer dated.. no one can figure out economy...  questions: 1. why would any of the discretionary storage operators withdraw gas in the winter based on the current curve? 2. where do you think index gets set this month? i am thinking that utilities will overestimate loads for Nov01 and buy more during bidweek.. index gets set high and depending on Nov weather.. it could come back onto the market weakening cash again.. 3. do you have a view on eastern power for the winter? i do not understand the market drivers in the winter.  thanks very much, c\n",

      " Phillip & Keith  Attached is the first draw request, I will need some of these funds immediately. I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.  Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).  I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00. I look forward to hearing from you.   Greg   - Draw # 1 - 10.25.01.xls\n",

Seems like they have not been successful with plan A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll keep chasing it.
